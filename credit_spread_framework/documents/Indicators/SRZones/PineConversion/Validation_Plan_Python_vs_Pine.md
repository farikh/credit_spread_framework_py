# ✅ Validation Plan: Matching Python Logic to Pine Script Behavior

## 🧭 1. Define the Scope of What You're Testing

| Feature / Calculation              | Validation Required                        | Method                                                    |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Pivot High / Low Detection         | Match exact bar locations of pivots.       | Visual chart overlays + printed bar timestamps.           |
| Support/Resistance Zone Generation | Zones match in position, width, and score. | Compare zone ranges side-by-side (table or plot).         |
| Sinc Filtering / Smoothing Logic   | Smoothed pivot values align.               | Compare raw vs. smoothed pivots numerically and visually. |

---

## 🗓️ 2. Use a Known Historical Date Range for Testing

- Pick 1–2 weeks of SPX data where you already have Pine-drawn zones.
- Save the exact OHLC data used in TradingView (export CSV if needed).
- This ensures both Python and Pine are operating on identical inputs.

---

## 🛠️ 3. Build a Data Export / Snapshot Tool in Python

Export all detected pivots and zones from your Python process to a CSV or database table with:

```
bar_timestamp, bar_index, high, low, is_pivot_high, is_pivot_low, zone_top, zone_bottom, zone_type, score
```

Include time-based IDs so you can match the exact bars visually.

---

## 🖼️ 4. Overlay Python Results on a Chart

Use `matplotlib`, `plotly`, or `bokeh` to:

- Plot the OHLC bars.
- Draw vertical lines or markers on Python-detected pivots.
- Draw rectangles/boxes for detected zones.

Color-code:

- Pivot High: 🔴 Red dot.
- Pivot Low: 🟢 Green dot.
- Resistance Zone: Red box.
- Support Zone: Green box.

---

## 🪟 5. Screenshot Matching (Pine vs. Python)

In TradingView:

- Use the same date range and zoom level.
- Draw the zones via your Pine Script.
- Screenshot the chart.

In Python:

- Generate the matching chart using your plotted pivots and zones.
- Manually side-by-side compare.

---

## 📋 6. Automate Bar-by-Bar Comparison (Optional But Powerful!)

Write a Python script to:

- Compare pivot detection flags for each timestamp.
- Compare zone start/end and scores.
- Report any mismatches like:

```
MISMATCH: 2025-04-02 10:15 - Pivot High in Pine, NOT detected in Python.
MISMATCH: Zone from 5280–5295 (Pine) differs from Python 5282–5294.
```

---

## 🎯 7. Add Manual Spot-Check Tool for Individual Dates/Bars

Example in Python:

```python
check_timestamp = '2025-04-02 10:15'
plot_zone_debug(check_timestamp)
```

- Zoom into that specific bar and surrounding pivots/zones.
- Overlay all detected pivots/zones at that exact time.

---

## 📂 8. Document Your Test Cases and Results

| Date Range Tested        | Data Source Verified     | Pivots Match? | Zones Match?                 | Notes                   |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------ | ------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| 2025-04-01 to 2025-04-05 | SPX 3-min DB             | ✅ Yes        | ❌ Near misses on some zones | Adjust smoothing param. |
| 2025-04-08 full day      | Exported TradingView CSV | ✅ Yes        | ✅ Yes                       | Fully aligned           |

---

## 🏆 9. Optional: Visual Difference Report

Generate side-by-side comparison plots:

- **Left:** Pine chart screenshot.
- **Right:** Python-generated chart.
- Optional: Overlay Pine vs. Python pivots and zones on the same chart with different colors.

---

## 🚀 10. Future-Proofing (Bonus Round)

Once validated manually, add **unit tests** or **automated tests** for:

- Pivot logic.
- Zone generation.
- Parameter changes (e.g., different pivot strengths).

Alert if future changes break pivot matching.
