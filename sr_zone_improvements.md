# SR Zone Indicator Improvements

## Analysis Results

After analyzing the SR zone detection with different parameter configurations, we've identified several key findings that explain why the 5420 support zone visible in TradingView isn't being detected in our implementation.

### Key Findings

1. **Zone Detection**: Our algorithm can detect a zone at 5410.67, which is close to the target 5420 zone, but not exactly at the same level.

2. **Parameter Impact**: The most important parameters affecting zone detection are:

   - `precision`: Controls the granularity of the histogram bins
   - `filter_len`: Controls the smoothing of the histogram
   - `threshold_ratio`: Controls how prominent a peak needs to be to be considered a zone

3. **September 2024 Lows**: The SQL data confirms the presence of significant lows in early September:

   - Sept 6: Low of 5402.62
   - Sept 9: Low of 5434.49
   - Sept 11: Low of 5406.96

4. **Best Configuration**: The configuration that gets closest to detecting the 5420 zone is:

   ```json
   {
     "pivot_lookback": 50,
     "filter_len": 3,
     "precision": 75,
     "threshold_ratio": 0.25,
     "include_ph": true,
     "include_pl": true,
     "lengths": [5, 10, 20, 50]
   }
   ```

5. **Qualifier Impact**: The "linear" qualifier is most effective at detecting the zone near 5420, with a detected zone at 5410.67.

## Recommended Improvements

To better match TradingView's SR zone detection, particularly for the 5420 support zone, we recommend the following improvements:

### 1. Histogram Bin Adjustment

The current implementation creates histogram bins based on the min and max pivot levels. This can lead to zones being detected at slightly different levels than expected. We should:

- Adjust the bin size calculation to create more precise bins around significant price levels
- Consider using a non-uniform bin size that's more granular around areas with many pivots

### 2. Peak Detection Enhancement

The peak detection algorithm should be enhanced to:

- Better handle closely spaced peaks (like the September lows)
- Consider the significance of multiple pivots at similar levels
- Prioritize recent pivots more heavily in the "time" weighting method

### 3. Historical Persistence Refinement

The historical persistence mechanism should be refined to:

- Keep important support/resistance zones active for longer periods
- Only invalidate zones when there's clear evidence they're no longer relevant
- Consider the strength of the zone when determining persistence

### 4. Specific Implementation Changes

1. **Modify the histogram bin calculation**:

   ```python
   # Current approach
   edges = np.linspace(mn, mx, self.precision + 1)

   # Improved approach
   # Use more bins around areas with many pivots
   pivot_density = np.histogram(pivot_lvls, bins=20)[0]
   high_density_areas = np.where(pivot_density > np.mean(pivot_density))[0]
   # Allocate more bins to high-density areas
   ```

2. **Enhance peak detection**:

   ```python
   # Current threshold approach
   thresh = threshold_ratio * max_hist

   # Improved approach
   # Use adaptive thresholding based on local histogram characteristics
   local_mean = np.convolve(hist, np.ones(5)/5, mode='same')
   local_std = np.sqrt(np.convolve((hist - local_mean)**2, np.ones(5)/5, mode='same'))
   thresh = local_mean + threshold_ratio * local_std
   ```

3. **Improve time weighting**:

   ```python
   # Current time weighting
   w = bar_index - pivot_bar

   # Improved approach
   # Use exponential decay for time weighting
   days_ago = (current_date - pivot_date).days
   w = np.exp(-days_ago / 30)  # 30-day half-life
   ```

## Implementation Plan

1. Create a modified version of the SR zone indicator with these improvements
2. Test with historical data, particularly focusing on the September 2024 period
3. Compare the results with TradingView's SR zones
4. Fine-tune parameters as needed

By implementing these improvements, we should be able to better detect important support/resistance zones like the 5420 level, making our implementation more closely match TradingView's behavior.
